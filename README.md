# Angular2 SASS GULP Boilerplate

## Dependencies

This plugin uses the latest `Angular2 Beta release`. You will also need to have gulp & sass installed globally.

It's a good idea to always use the latest version of Angular2 - but there might be some compatilbility issues.

## Installation

1. Install the latest node.js and npm
2. Install gulp globally 'npm i -g gulp'
3. Install sass globally 'npm i -g sass'
4. Install TypeScript globally 'npm i -g typescript'
5. Install tsd globally 'npm i -g tsd'
6. Try to run 'npm install'

## Usage

**Default usage**

Run the plugin from the command palette:

A. Simple build 'gulp' --> this will run the default task
B. GULP Server with some basic file watching 'gulp serve'

## Issues

This boilerplate has been implemented on Windows 8.1 using Sublime 3 and TypeScript.

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/cureon/angular2-sass-gulp-boilerplate/issues) if you find it doesn't work as expected on your setup.

## Contribution

This is open - so please feel free to help me implement better GULP tasks, test automation and whatever is needed to make this a great boilerplate.

## Thanks

Many thanks to the Angular2 Team and everyone involved in any dependency project.
Also many thanks to everyone who will use and test this and report issues.
